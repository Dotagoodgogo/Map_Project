# 3D Reconstruction of the "iceworld" Map from Counter-Strike

## Overview

This project is a 3D reconstruction of the "iceworld" map from the popular first-person shooter game Counter-Strike. Using 3D modeling software, I created a 3D model of the map that accurately represents the original map in terms of layout, structure, and gameplay. The model can be used in a virtual environment to allow players to experience the map in a new way or as a training tool for players to practice their gameplay on the map.

## Skills Demonstrated

- 3D modeling and texturing
- Knowledge of computer graphics and 3D geometry
- Understanding of the gameplay and layout of the "iceworld" map in Counter-Strike
- Experience with 3D modeling software

## Career Interests

This project showcases my interest in the field of game development, specifically in the area of gameplay programming and 3D modeling. My goal is to become a gameplay programmer or a 3D artist in the gaming industry.

## Conclusion

This project was a challenging but rewarding exercise in using 3D geometry to recreate an iconic map from a popular game. The final model accurately represents the original map and could be used in a variety of ways, such as in a virtual environment or as a training tool for players. I hope to continue to develop my skills in game development and to create more projects like this in the future.

## Description
This project is called “Ice world.” Maybe you don’t know what that is, but if you are a
professional player. I believe you may see it somewhere. My final project is a map, and my
thought is coming from a game which is called counter-strike(CS). I believe it has been a
pretty popular FPS game since 2000. The reason I made this is not only its popularity but
also because this is the first game I played on the computer. This game opened my eye to
the whole game and internet world. Time goes fast. I still remember that I kept killing AI bots
on this map and finally reached 100 kills when I was in elementary school. It is the memory
of our generation. Therefore, I pick this map as my project as my best memory of my
childhood.

## Some features
The majority of the project is made by triangle strips and triangle-fan. The procedure seems
pretty easy, but I need to set a bunch of parameters such as vertices, normal, and texture
mapping, which are really time-consuming; meanwhile, the project is based on project phong lighting, object movement, and texture mapping. I
keep the lights but make them a little bit blue which represents my childhood has gone and
have grown up. The texture of the walls and floor are snow and marble. I tried to find the same texture as
in the original map, but I failed. Although I didn’t implement any animation, I think that is the
map I made. I am still proud of it.

Some Animation instructions:
1. Press 'r' or 'R' (Run) to toggle(off and on) running the animation.
2. Press arrow keys to adjust the view direction.
3. Press HOME or END to closer to and farther away from the scene.
4. Press 'w' or 'W' (wireframe) to toggle whether wireframe or fill mode.
5. Press 'M' (mesh) to increase the mesh resolution.
6. Press 'm' (mesh) to decrease the mesh resolution.
7. Press 'E' key (Emissive) to toggle rendering Emissive light.
8. Press 'A' key (Ambient) to toggle rendering Ambient light.
9. Press 'D' key (Diffuse) to toggle rendering Diffuse light.
10. Press 'S' key (Specular) to toggle rendering Specular light.
11. Press 'V' key (Viewer) to toggle using a local viewer.
12. Press 'Q' key to toggle viewing all the objects besides the floor.
13. Press ESCAPE to exit.Some animation instructions：
