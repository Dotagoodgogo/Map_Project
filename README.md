# 3D Reconstruction of the "iceworld" Map from Counter-Strike

## Overview

This project is a 3D reconstruction of the "iceworld" map from the popular first-person shooter game Counter-Strike. Using 3D modeling software, I created a 3D model of the map that accurately represents the original map in terms of layout, structure, and gameplay.

Some Animation instructions:
1. Press 'r' or 'R' (Run) to toggle(off and on) running the animation.
2. Press arrow keys to adjust the view direction.
3. Press HOME or END to closer to and farther away from the scene.
4. Press 'w' or 'W' (wireframe) to toggle whether wireframe or fill mode.
5. Press 'M' (mesh) to increase the mesh resolution.
6. Press 'm' (mesh) to decrease the mesh resolution.
7. Press 'E' key (Emissive) to toggle rendering Emissive light.
8. Press 'A' key (Ambient) to toggle rendering Ambient light.
9. Press 'D' key (Diffuse) to toggle rendering Diffuse light.
10. Press 'S' key (Specular) to toggle rendering Specular light.
11. Press 'V' key (Viewer) to toggle using a local viewer.
12. Press 'Q' key to toggle viewing all the objects besides the floor.
13. Press ESCAPE to exit.Some animation instructionsï¼š

## Skills Demonstrated

- Points, lines, and polygons   
- Rotaion and translation 
- Shadows. Surfaces and normal vectors.
- Phong lighting.
- 3D rendering and shading techniques
- 3D texturing 
- Experience with 3D modeling software

## Career Interests

This project showcases my interest in the field of game development, specifically in the area of gameplay programming and 3D modeling. My goal is to become a gameplay programmer or a 3D artist in the gaming industry.

## Conclusion

This project was a challenging but rewarding exercise in using 3D geometry to recreate an iconic map from a popular game. The final model accurately represents the original mapI hope to continue to develop my skills in game development and to create more projects like this in the future.
