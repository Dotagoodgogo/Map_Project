## Description
This project is called “Ice world.” Maybe you don’t know what that is, but if you are a
professional player. I believe you may see it somewhere. My final project is a map, and my
thought is coming from a game which is called counter-strike(CS). I believe it has been a
pretty popular FPS game since 2000. The reason I made this is not only its popularity but
also because this is the first game I played on the computer. This game opened my eye to
the whole game and internet world. Time goes fast. I still remember that I kept killing AI bots
on this map and finally reached 100 kills when I was in elementary school. It is the memory
of our generation. Therefore, I pick this map as my project as my best memory of my
childhood.

## Some features
The majority of the project is made by triangle strips and triangle-fan. The procedure seems
pretty easy, but I need to set a bunch of parameters such as vertices, normal, and texture
mapping, which are really time-consuming; meanwhile, the project is based on project 6. I
keep the lights but make them a little bit blue which represents my childhood has gone and
have grown up. Furthermore, since the project is based on project 6. All keys which can
access in project 6 also can access in the final project. I didn’t add any keys beyond project
6. The texture of the walls and floor are snow and marble. I tried to find the same texture as
in the original map, but I failed. Although I didn’t implement any animation, I think that is the
map I made. I am still proud of it.
